much liker than your painted counterfeit:\\n  so should the lines of life that life repair,\\n  which this, time's pencil, or my pupil pen,\\n  neither in inward worth nor outward fair,\\n  can make

your eyes,\\n  and in fresh numbers number all your graces,\\n  the age to come would say 'this poet lies;\\n  such heavenly touches ne'er touch'd earthly faces.'\\n  so should my papers, yellow'd with their age,\\n  be scorn'd, like old men of less truth than tongue,\\n  and your true rights be term'd a poet's rage\\n  and stretched metre of an antique song:\\n    but were some child of yours alive that time,\\n    you should live twice,--in it, and in my rhyme.\\n\\n  xviii\\n\\n  shall i compare thee to a summer's day?\\n  thou art more lovely and more temperate:\\n  rough winds do shake the darling buds of may,\\n  and summer's lease hath all too short a date:\\n  sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,\\n  and often is his gold complexion dimm'd,\\n  and every fair from fair sometime declines,\\n  by chance, or nature's changing course untrimm'd:\\n  but thy eternal summer shall not fade,\\n  nor lose possession of that fair thou ow'st,\\n  nor shall death brag thou wander'st in his shade,\\n  when in eternal lines to time thou grow'st,\\n    so long as men can breathe, or eyes can see,\\n    so long lives this, and this gives life to thee.\\n\\n  xix\\n\\n

crime:\\n  o! carve not with thy hours my love's fair brow,\\n  nor draw no lines there with thine antique pen;\\n  him in thy course untainted do allow\\n  for beauty's pattern to succeeding men.\\n    yet, do thy worst old time: despite thy wrong,\\n    my love shall in my verse ever live young.\\n\\n  xx\\n\\n  a woman's face with nature's own hand painted,\\n  hast thou, the master mistress of

whereupon it gazeth;\\n  a man in hue all 'hues' in his controlling,\\n  which steals men's eyes and women's souls amazeth.\\n  and for a woman wert thou first created;\\n  till nature, as she wrought thee, fell a-doting,\\n  and by addition me of thee defeated,\\n  by adding one thing to my purpose nothing.\\n    but since she prick'd thee out for women's pleasure,\\n    mine be thy love and thy

heart,\\n  which in thy breast doth live, as thine in me:\\n  how can i then be elder than thou art?\\n  o! therefore love, be of thyself so wary\\n  as i, not for myself, but for thee will;\\n  bearing thy heart, which i will keep so chary\\n  as tender nurse her babe from faring ill.\\n    presume not on thy heart when mine is slain,\\n    thou gav'st me thine not to give back again.\\n\\n  xxiii\\n\\n  as an unperfect actor on the stage,\\n  who with his fear is put beside his part,\\n  or some fierce thing replete with too much rage,\\n  whose strength's abundance weakens his own

 which in my bosom's shop is hanging still,\\n  that hath his windows glazed with thine eyes.\\n  now see what good turns eyes for eyes have done:\\n  mine eyes have drawn thy shape, and thine for me\\n  are windows to my breast, where-through the sun\\n  delights to peep, to gaze therein on thee;\\n    yet eyes this cunning want to grace their art,\\n    they draw but what they see, know not the heart.\\n\\n  xxv\\n\\n  let those who are in favour with their stars\\n  of public honour and proud titles boast,\\n  whilst i, whom fortune of such triumph bars\\n  unlook'd for joy in that i honour most.\\n  great princes' favourites their fair leaves spread\\n  but as the marigold at the sun's eye,\\n  and in themselves their pride lies buried,\\n  for at a frown they in their glory

of thine\\n  in thy soul's thought, all naked, will bestow it:\\n  till whatsoever star that guides my moving,\\n  points on me graciously with fair aspect,\\n  and puts apparel on my tatter'd loving,\\n  to show me worthy of thy sweet respect:\\n    then may i dare to boast how i do love thee;\\n    till then, not show my head where thou mayst prove me.\\n\\n  xxvii\\n\\n  weary with toil, i haste me to my bed,\\n  the dear respose for limbs with travel tir'd;\\n  but then begins a journey in my head\\n  to work my mind, when body's work's expired:\\n  for then my thoughts--from far where i abide--\\n  intend a zealous pilgrimage to thee,\\n  and keep my drooping eyelids open wide,\\n  looking on darkness which the blind do see:\\n  save that my soul's imaginary sight\\n  presents thy shadow to my sightless view,\\n  which, like a jewel hung in ghastly night,\\n  makes black night beauteous, and her old face new.\\n    lo! thus, by day my limbs, by night my mind,\\n    for thee, and for myself, no quiet find.\\n\\n  xxviii\\n\\n  how can i then return in happy plight,\\n  that am debarre'd the benefit of rest?\\n  when day's oppression is not eas'd by night,\\n  but day by night and night by day oppress'd,\\n  and each, though enemies to either's reign,\\n  do in consent shake hands to torture me,\\n  the one by toil, the other to complain\\n  how far i toil, still farther off from thee.\\n  i tell the day, to please him thou art bright,\\n  and dost him grace when clouds do blot the heaven:\\n  so flatter i the swart-complexion'd night,\\n  when sparkling stars twire not thou gild'st the even.\\n    but day doth daily draw my sorrows longer,\\n    and night doth nightly make grief's length seem stronger.\\n\\n  xxix\\n\\n  when in disgrace with fortune and men's eyes\\n  i all alone beweep my outcast state,\\n  and trouble deaf heaven with my bootless cries,\\n  and look upon myself, and curse my fate,\\n  wishing me like to one more rich in hope,\\n  featur'd like him, like him with friends possess'd,\\n  desiring this man's art, and that man's scope,\\n  with what i most enjoy contented least;\\n  yet in these thoughts my self almost despising,\\n  haply i think on thee,-- and then my state,\\n  like to the lark at break of day arising\\n  from sullen earth, sings hymns at heaven's gate;\\n    for thy sweet love remember'd such wealth brings\\n    that then i scorn to change my state with kings.\\n\\n  xxx\\n\\n  when to the sessions of sweet silent thought\\n  i summon up remembrance of things past,\\n  i sigh the lack of many a thing i sought,\\n  and with old woes new wail my dear time's waste:\\n  then can i drown an eye, unused to flow,\\n  for precious friends hid in death's dateless night,\\n  and weep afresh love's long since cancell'd woe,\\n  and moan the expense of many a vanish'd sight:\\n  then can i grieve at grievances foregone,\\n  and heavily from woe to woe tell o'er\\n  the sad account of fore-bemoaned moan,\\n  which i new pay as if not paid before.\\n    but if the while i think on thee, dear friend,\\n    all losses are restor'd and sorrows end.\\n\\n  xxxi\\n\\n  thy bosom is endeared with all hearts,\\n  which i by lacking have supposed dead;\\n  and there reigns love, and all love's loving parts,\\n  and all those friends which i thought buried.\\n  how many a holy and obsequious tear\\n  hath dear religious love stol'n from mine eye,\\n  as interest of the dead, which now appear\\n  but things remov'd that hidden in thee lie!\\n  thou art the grave where buried love doth live,\\n  hung with the trophies of my lovers gone,\\n  who all their parts of me to thee did give,\\n  that due of many now is thine alone:\\n    their images i lov'd, i view in thee,\\n    and thou--all they--hast all the all of me.\\n\\n  xxxii\\n\\n  if thou survive my well-contented day,\\n  when that churl death my bones with dust shall cover\\n  and shalt by fortune once more re-survey\\n  these poor rude lines of thy deceased lover,\\n  compare them with the bett'ring of the time,\\n  and though they be outstripp'd by every pen,\\n  reserve them for my love, not for their rhyme,\\n  exceeded by the height of happier men.\\n  o! then vouchsafe me but this loving thought:\\n  'had my friend's muse grown with this growing age,\\n  a dearer birth than this his love had brought,\\n  to march in ranks of better equipage:\\n    but since he died and poets better prove,\\n    theirs for their style i'll read, his for his love'.\\n\\n  xxxiii\\n\\n  full many a glorious

all triumphant splendour on my brow;\\n  but out! alack! he was but one hour mine,\\n  the region cloud hath mask'd him from me now.\\n    yet him for this my love no whit disdaineth;\\n    suns of the world may stain when heaven's sun staineth.\\n\\n  xxxiv\\n\\n  why didst thou promise such a beauteous day,\\n  and make me travel forth without my cloak,\\n  to let base clouds o'ertake me in my way,\\n  hiding thy bravery in their rotten smoke?\\n  'tis not enough that through the cloud thou break,\\n  to dry the rain on my storm-beaten face,\\n  for no man well of such a salve can speak,\\n  that heals the wound, and cures not the disgrace:\\n  nor can thy shame give physic to my grief;\\n  though thou repent, yet i have still the loss:\\n  the offender's sorrow lends but weak relief\\n  to him that bears the strong offence's cross.\\n    ah! but those tears are pearl which thy love sheds,\\n    and they are rich and ransom all ill deeds.\\n\\n  xxxv\\n\\n  no more be griev'd at that

sourly robs from me.\\n\\n  xxxvi\\n\\n  let me confess that we two must be twain,\\n  although our undivided loves are one:\\n  so shall those blots that do with me remain,\\n  without thy help, by me be borne alone.\\n  in our two loves there is but one respect,\\n  though in our lives a separable spite,\\n  which though it alter not love's sole effect,\\n  yet doth it steal sweet hours from love's delight.\\n  i may not evermore acknowledge thee,\\n  lest my bewailed guilt should do thee shame,\\n  nor thou with public kindness honour me,\\n  unless thou take that honour from thy name:\\n    but do not so, i love thee in such sort,\\n    as thou being mine, mine is thy good report.\\n\\n  xxxvii\\n\\n  as a decrepit father takes delight\\n  to see his active child do deeds of youth,\\n  so i, made lame by fortune's dearest spite,\\n  take all my comfort of thy worth and truth;\\n  for whether beauty, birth, or wealth, or wit,\\n  or any of these all, or all, or more,\\n

guest,\\n  and in his thoughts of love doth share a part:\\n  so, either by thy picture or my love,\\n  thy self away, art present still with me;\\n  for thou not farther than my thoughts canst move,\\n  and i am still with them, and they with thee;\\n    or, if they sleep, thy picture in my sight\\n    awakes my heart, to heart's and eye's delight.\\n\\n  xlviii\\n\\n  how careful was i when i took my way,\\n  each trifle under truest bars to thrust,\\n  that to my use it might unused stay\\n  from hands of falsehood, in sure wards of trust!\\n  but thou, to whom my jewels trifles are,\\n  most worthy comfort, now my greatest grief,\\n  thou best of dearest, and mine only care,\\n  art left the prey of every vulgar thief.\\n  thee have i not lock'd up in any chest,\\n  save where thou art not, though i feel thou art,\\n  within the gentle closure of my breast,\\n  from whence at pleasure thou mayst come and part;\\n    and even thence thou wilt be stol'n i fear,\\n    for truth proves thievish for a prize so dear.\\n\\n  xlix\\n\\n  against that time, if ever that time come,\\n  when i shall see thee frown on my defects,\\n  when as thy love hath cast his utmost sum,\\n  call'd to that audit by advis'd respects;\\n  against that time when thou shalt strangely pass,\\n  and scarcely greet me with that sun, thine eye,\\n  when love, converted from the thing it was,\\n  shall reasons find of settled gravity;\\n  against that time do i ensconce me here,\\n  within the knowledge of mine own desert,\\n  and this my hand, against my self uprear,\\n  to guard the lawful reasons on thy part:\\n    to leave poor me thou hast the strength of laws,\\n    since why to love i can allege no cause.\\n\\n  l\\n\\n  how heavy do i journey on the way,\\n  when what i seek, my weary travel's end,\\n  doth teach that ease and that repose to say,\\n  'thus far the miles are measured from thy friend!'\\n  the beast that bears me, tired with my woe,\\n  plods dully on, to bear that weight in me,\\n  as if by some instinct the wretch did know\\n  his rider lov'd not speed, being made from thee:\\n  the bloody spur cannot provoke him on,\\n  that sometimes anger thrusts into his hide,\\n  which heavily he answers with a groan,\\n  more sharp to me than spurring to his side;\\n    for that same groan doth put this in my mind,\\n    my grief lies onward, and my joy behind.\\n\\n  li\\n\\n  thus can my love excuse the slow offence\\n  of my dull bearer when from thee i speed:\\n  from where thou art why should i haste me thence?\\n  till i return, of posting is no need.\\n  o! what excuse will my poor beast then find,\\n  when swift extremity can seem but slow?\\n  then should i spur, though mounted on the wind,\\n  in winged speed no motion shall i know,\\n  then can no horse with my desire keep pace;\\n  therefore desire, of perfect'st love being made,\\n  shall neigh--no dull flesh--in his fiery race;\\n  but love, for love, thus shall excuse my jade,--\\n    'since from thee going, he went wilful-slow,\\n    towards thee i'll run, and give him leave to go.'\\n\\n  lii\\n\\n  so am i as the rich, whose blessed key,\\n  can bring him to his sweet up-locked treasure,\\n  the which he will not every hour survey,\\n  for blunting the fine point of seldom pleasure.\\n  therefore are feasts so solemn and so rare,\\n  since, seldom coming in that long year set,\\n  like stones of worth they thinly placed are,\\n  or captain jewels in the carcanet.\\n  so is the time that keeps you as my chest,\\n  or as the wardrobe which the robe doth hide,\\n  to make some special instant special-blest,\\n  by new unfolding his imprison'd pride.\\n    blessed are you whose worthiness gives scope,\\n    being had, to triumph; being lacked, to hope.\\n\\n  liii\\n\\n  what is your substance, whereof are you made,\\n  that millions of strange shadows on you tend?\\n  since every one, hath every one, one shade,\\n  and you but one, can every shadow lend.\\n  describe adonis, and the counterfeit\\n  is poorly imitated after you;\\n  on helen's cheek all art of beauty set,\\n  and you in grecian tires are painted new:\\n  speak of the spring, and foison of the year,\\n  the one doth shadow of your beauty show,\\n  the other as your bounty doth appear;\\n  and you in every blessed shape we know.\\n    in all external grace you have some part,\\n    but you like none, none you, for constant heart.\\n\\n  liv\\n\\n  o! how much more doth beauty beauteous seem\\n  by that sweet ornament which truth doth give.\\n  the rose looks fair, but fairer we it deem\\n  for that sweet odour, which doth in it live.\\n  the canker blooms have full as deep a dye\\n  as the perfumed tincture of the roses.\\n  hang on such thorns, and play as wantonly\\n  when summer's breath their masked buds discloses:\\n  but, for their virtue only is their show,\\n  they live unwoo'd, and unrespected fade;\\n  die to themselves. sweet roses do not so;\\n  of their sweet deaths, are sweetest odours made:\\n    and so of you, beauteous and lovely youth,\\n    when that shall vade, by verse distills your truth.\\n\\n  lv\\n\\n  not marble, nor the gilded monuments\\n  of princes, shall outlive this powerful rhyme;\\n  but you shall shine more bright in these contents\\n  than unswept stone, besmear'd with sluttish time.\\n  when wasteful war shall statues overturn,\\n  and broils root out the work of masonry,\\n  nor mars his sword, nor war's quick fire shall burn\\n  the living record of your memory.\\n  'gainst death, and all-oblivious enmity\\n  shall you pace forth; your praise shall still find room\\n  even in the eyes of all posterity\\n  that wear this world out to the ending doom.\\n    so, till the judgment that yourself arise,\\n    you live in this, and dwell in lovers' eyes.\\n\\n  lvi\\n\\n  sweet love, renew thy force; be it not said\\n  thy edge should blunter be than appetite,\\n  which but to-day by feeding is allay'd,\\n  to-morrow sharpened in his former might:\\n  so, love, be thou, although to-day thou fill\\n  thy hungry eyes, even till they wink with fulness,\\n  to-morrow see again, and do not kill\\n  the spirit of love, with a perpetual dulness.\\n  let this sad interim like the ocean be\\n  which parts the shore, where two contracted new\\n  come daily to the banks, that when they see\\n  return of love, more blest may be the view;\\n    or call it winter, which being full of care,\\n    makes summer's welcome, thrice more wished, more rare.\\n\\n  lvii\\n\\n  being your slave what

hour,\\n  whilst i, my sovereign, watch the clock for you,\\n  nor think the bitterness of absence sour,\\n  when you have bid your servant once adieu;\\n  nor dare i question with my jealous thought\\n  where you may be, or your affairs suppose,\\n  but, like a sad slave, stay and think of nought\\n  save, where you are, how happy you make those.\\n    so true a fool is love, that in your will,\\n    though you do anything, he thinks no ill.\\n\\n  lviii\\n\\n  that god forbid, that made me first your slave,\\n  i should in thought control your times of pleasure,\\n  or at your hand the account of hours to crave,\\n  being your vassal, bound to stay your leisure!\\n  o! let me suffer, being at your beck,\\n  the imprison'd absence of your liberty;\\n  and patience, tame to sufferance, bide each check,\\n  without accusing you of injury.\\n  be where you list, your charter is so strong\\n  that you yourself may privilage your time\\n  to what you will; to you it doth belong\\n  yourself to pardon of self-doing crime.\\n    i am to wait, though waiting so be hell,\\n    not blame your pleasure be it ill or well.\\n\\n  lix\\n\\n  if there be nothing new, but that which is\\n  hath been before, how are our brains beguil'd,\\n  which labouring for invention bear amiss\\n  the second burthen of a former child!\\n  o! that record could with a backward look,\\n  even of five hundred courses of the sun,\\n  show me your image in some antique book,\\n  since mind at first in character was done!\\n  that i might see what the old world could say\\n  to this composed wonder of your frame;\\n  wh'r we are mended, or wh'r better they,\\n  or whether revolution be the same.\\n    o! sure i am the wits of former days,\\n    to subjects worse have given admiring praise.\\n\\n  lx\\n\\n  like as the waves make towards the pebbled shore,\\n  so do our minutes hasten to their end;\\n  each changing place with that which goes before,\\n  in sequent toil

gift confound.\\n  time doth transfix the flourish set on youth\\n  and delves the parallels in beauty's brow,\\n  feeds on the rarities of nature's truth,\\n  and nothing stands but for his scythe to mow:\\n    and yet to times in hope, my verse shall stand.\\n    praising thy worth, despite his cruel hand.\\n\\n  lxi\\n\\n  is it thy will, thy image should keep open\\n  my heavy eyelids to the weary night?\\n  dost thou desire my slumbers should be broken,\\n  while shadows like to thee do mock my sight?\\n  is it thy spirit that thou send'st from thee\\n  so far from home into my deeds to pry,\\n  to find out shames and idle hours in me,\\n  the scope and tenure of thy jealousy?\\n  o, no! thy love, though much, is not so great:\\n  it is my love that keeps mine eye awake:\\n  mine own true love that doth my rest defeat,\\n  to play the watchman ever for thy sake:\\n    for thee watch i, whilst thou dost wake elsewhere,\\n    from me far off, with others all too near.\\n\\n  lxii\\n\\n  sin of self-love possesseth all mine eye\\n  and all my soul, and all my every part;\\n  and for this sin there is no remedy,\\n  it is so grounded inward in my heart.\\n  methinks no face

painting my age with beauty of thy days.\\n\\n  lxiii\\n\\n  against my love shall be as i am now,\\n  with time's injurious hand crush'd and o'erworn;\\n  when hours have drain'd his blood and fill'd his brow\\n  with lines and wrinkles; when his youthful morn\\n  hath travell'd on to age's steepy night;\\n  and all those beauties whereof now he's king\\n  are vanishing, or vanished out of sight,\\n  stealing away the treasure of his spring;\\n  for such a time do i now fortify\\n  against confounding age's cruel knife,\\n  that he shall never cut from memory\\n  my sweet love's beauty, though my lover's life:\\n    his beauty shall in these black lines be seen,\\n    and they shall live, and he in them still green.\\n\\n  lxiv\\n\\n  when i have seen by time's fell hand defac'd\\n  the rich-proud cost of outworn buried age;\\n  when sometime lofty towers i see down-raz'd,\\n  and brass eternal slave to mortal rage;\\n  when i have seen the hungry ocean gain\\n  advantage on the kingdom of the shore,\\n  and the firm soil win of the watery main,\\n  increasing store with loss, and loss with store;\\n  when i have seen such interchange of state,\\n  or state itself confounded, to decay;\\n  ruin hath taught me thus to ruminate--\\n  that time will come and take my love away.\\n    this thought is as a death which cannot choose\\n    but weep to have, that which it fears to lose.\\n\\n  lxv\\n\\n  since brass, nor stone, nor earth, nor boundless sea,\\n  but sad mortality o'ersways their power,\\n  how with this rage shall beauty hold a plea,\\n  whose action is no stronger than a flower?\\n  o! how shall summer's honey breath hold out,\\n  against the wrackful siege of battering days,\\n  when rocks impregnable are not so stout,\\n  nor gates of steel so strong but time decays?\\n  o fearful meditation! where, alack,\\n  shall time's best jewel from time's chest lie hid?\\n  or what strong hand can hold his swift foot back?\\n  or who his spoil of beauty can forbid?\\n    o! none, unless this miracle have might,\\n    that in black ink my love may still shine bright.\\n\\n  lxvi\\n\\n  tired with all these, for restful death i cry,\\n  as to behold desert a beggar born,\\n  and needy nothing trimm'd in jollity,\\n  and purest faith unhappily forsworn,\\n  and gilded honour shamefully misplac'd,\\n  and maiden virtue rudely strumpeted,\\n  and right perfection wrongfully disgrac'd,\\n  and strength by limping sway disabled\\n  and art made tongue-tied by authority,\\n  and folly--doctor-like--controlling skill,\\n  and simple truth miscall'd simplicity,\\n  and captive good attending captain ill:\\n    tir'd with all these, from these would i be gone,\\n    save that, to die, i leave my love alone.\\n\\n  lxvii\\n\\n  ah! wherefore with infection should he live,\\n  and with his presence grace impiety,\\n  that sin by him advantage should achieve,\\n  and lace itself with his society?\\n  why should false painting imitate his cheek,\\n  and steel dead seeming of his living hue?\\n  why should poor beauty indirectly seek\\n  roses of shadow, since his rose is true?\\n  why should he live, now nature bankrupt is,\\n  beggar'd of blood to blush through lively veins?\\n  for she hath no exchequer now but his,\\n  and proud of many, lives upon his gains.\\n    o! him she stores, to show what wealth she had\\n    in days long since, before these last so bad.\\n\\n  lxviii\\n\\n  thus is his cheek the map of days outworn,\\n  when beauty lived and died as flowers do now,\\n  before these bastard signs of fair were born,\\n  or durst inhabit on a living brow;\\n  before the golden tresses of the dead,\\n  the right of sepulchres, were shorn away,\\n  to live a second life on second head;\\n  ere beauty's dead fleece made another gay:\\n  in him those holy antique hours are seen,\\n  without all ornament, itself and true,\\n  making no summer of another's green,\\n  robbing no old to dress his beauty new;\\n    and him as for a map doth nature store,\\n    to show false art what beauty was of yore.\\n\\n  lxix\\n\\n  those parts of thee that the world's eye doth view\\n  want nothing that the

those same tongues, that give thee so thine own,\\n  in other accents do this praise confound\\n  by seeing farther than the eye hath shown.\\n  they look into the beauty of thy mind,\\n  and that in guess they measure by thy deeds;\\n  then--churls--their thoughts, although their eyes were kind,\\n  to thy fair flower add the rank smell of weeds:\\n    but why thy odour matcheth not thy show,\\n    the soil is this, that thou dost common grow.\\n\\n  lxx\\n\\n  that thou art blam'd shall not be thy defect,\\n  for slander's mark was ever yet the fair;\\n  the ornament of beauty is suspect,\\n  a crow that flies in heaven's sweetest air.\\n  so thou be good, slander doth but approve\\n  thy worth the greater being woo'd of time;\\n  for canker vice the sweetest buds doth love,\\n  and thou present'st a pure unstained prime.\\n  thou hast passed by the ambush of young days\\n  either not assail'd, or victor being charg'd;\\n  yet this thy praise cannot be so thy praise,\\n  to tie up envy, evermore enlarg'd,\\n    if some suspect of ill mask'd not thy show,\\n    then thou alone kingdoms of hearts shouldst owe.\\n\\n  lxxi\\n\\n  no longer mourn for me when i am dead\\n  than you shall hear the surly sullen bell\\n  give warning to the world that i am fled\\n  from this vile world with vilest worms to dwell:\\n  nay, if you read this line, remember not\\n  the hand that writ it, for i love you so,\\n  that i in your sweet thoughts would be forgot,\\n  if thinking on me then should make you woe.\\n  o! if,--i say you look upon this verse,\\n  when i perhaps compounded am with clay,\\n  do not so much as my poor name rehearse;\\n  but let your love even with my life decay;\\n    lest the wise world should look into your moan,\\n    and mock you with me after i am gone.\\n\\n  lxxii\\n\\n  o! lest the world should task you to recite\\n  what merit lived in me, that you should love\\n  after my death,--dear love, forget me quite,\\n  for you in me can nothing worthy prove;\\n  unless you would devise some virtuous lie,\\n  to do more for me than mine own desert,\\n  and hang more praise upon deceased i\\n  than niggard truth would willingly impart:\\n  o! lest your true love may seem false in this\\n  that you for love speak well of me untrue,\\n  my name be buried where my body is,\\n  and live no more to shame nor me nor you.\\n    for i am shamed by that which i bring forth,\\n    and so should you, to love things nothing worth.\\n\\n  lxxiii\\n\\n  that time of year thou mayst in me behold\\n  when yellow leaves, or none, or few, do hang\\n  upon those boughs which shake against the cold,\\n  bare ruin'd choirs, where late the sweet birds sang.\\n  in me thou see'st the twilight of such day\\n  as after sunset fadeth in the west;\\n  which by and by black night doth take away,\\n  death's second self, that seals up all in rest.\\n  in me thou see'st the glowing of such fire,\\n  that on the ashes of his youth doth lie,\\n  as the death-bed, whereon it must expire,\\n  consum'd with that which it was nourish'd by.\\n    this thou perceiv'st, which makes thy love more strong,\\n    to love that well, which thou must leave ere long.\\n\\n  lxxiv\\n\\n  but be contented: when that fell arrest\\n  without all bail shall carry me away,\\n  my life hath in this line some interest,\\n  which for memorial still with thee shall stay.\\n  when thou reviewest this, thou dost review\\n  the very part was consecrate to thee:\\n  the earth can have but earth, which is his due;\\n  my spirit is thine, the better part of me:\\n  so then thou hast but lost the dregs of life,\\n  the prey of worms, my body being dead;\\n  the coward conquest of a wretch's knife,\\n  too base of thee to be remembered.\\n    the worth of that is that which it contains,\\n    and that is this, and this with thee remains.\\n\\n  lxxv\\n\\n  so are you to my thoughts as food to life,\\n  or as sweet-season'd showers are to the ground;\\n  and for the peace of you i hold such strife\\n  as 'twixt a miser and his wealth is found.\\n  now proud as an enjoyer, and anon\\n  doubting the filching age will steal his treasure;\\n  now counting best to be with you alone,\\n  then better'd that the world may see my pleasure:\\n  sometime all full with feasting on your sight,\\n  and by and by clean starved for a look;\\n  possessing or pursuing no delight,\\n  save what is had, or must from you be took.\\n    thus do i pine and surfeit day by day,\\n    or gluttoning on all, or all away.\\n\\n  lxxvi\\n\\n  why is my verse so barren of new pride,\\n  so far from variation or quick change?\\n  why with the time do i not glance aside\\n  to new-found methods, and to compounds strange?\\n  why write i still all one, ever the same,\\n  and keep invention in a noted weed,\\n  that every word doth almost tell my name,\\n  showing their birth, and where they did proceed?\\n  o! know sweet love i always write of you,\\n  and you and love are still my argument;\\n  so all my best is dressing old words new,\\n  spending again what is already spent:\\n    for as the sun is daily new and old,\\n    so is my love still telling what is told.\\n\\n  lxxvii\\n\\n  thy glass will show thee how thy beauties wear,\\n  thy dial how thy precious minutes waste;\\n  these vacant leaves thy mind's imprint will bear,\\n  and of this book, this learning mayst thou taste.\\n  the wrinkles which thy glass will truly show\\n  of mouthed graves will give thee memory;\\n  thou by thy dial's shady stealth mayst know\\n  time's thievish progress to eternity.\\n  look! what thy memory cannot contain,\\n  commit to these waste blanks, and thou shalt find\\n  those children nursed, deliver'd from thy brain,\\n  to take a new acquaintance of thy mind.\\n    these offices, so oft as thou wilt look,\\n    shall profit thee and much enrich thy book.\\n\\n  lxxviii\\n\\n  so oft have i invoked thee for my muse,\\n  and found such fair assistance in my verse\\n  as every alien pen hath got my use\\n  and under thee their poesy disperse.\\n  thine eyes, that taught the dumb on high to sing\\n  and heavy ignorance aloft to fly,\\n  have added feathers to the learned's wing\\n  and given grace a double majesty.\\n  yet be most proud of that which i compile,\\n  whose influence is thine, and born of thee:\\n  in others' works thou dost but mend the style,\\n  and arts with thy sweet graces graced be;\\n    but thou art all my art, and dost advance\\n    as high as learning, my rude ignorance.\\n\\n  lxxix\\n\\n  whilst i alone did call upon thy aid,\\n  my verse alone had all thy gentle grace;\\n  but now my gracious numbers are decay'd,\\n  and my sick muse doth give an other place.\\n  i grant, sweet love, thy lovely argument\\n  deserves the travail of a worthier pen;\\n  yet what of thee thy poet doth invent\\n  he robs thee of, and pays it thee again.\\n  he lends thee virtue, and he stole that word\\n  from thy behaviour; beauty doth he give,\\n  and found it in thy cheek: he can afford\\n  no praise to thee, but what in thee doth live.\\n    then thank him not for that which he doth say,\\n    since what he owes thee, thou thyself dost pay.\\n\\n  lxxx\\n\\n  o! how i faint when i of you do write,\\n  knowing a better spirit doth use your name,\\n  and in the praise thereof spends all his might,\\n  to make me tongue-tied speaking of your fame!\\n  but since your worth--wide as the ocean is,--\\n  the humble as the proudest sail doth bear,\\n  my saucy bark, inferior far to his,\\n  on your broad main doth wilfully appear.\\n  your shallowest help will hold me up afloat,\\n  whilst he upon your soundless deep doth ride;\\n  or, being wrack'd, i am a worthless boat,\\n  he of tall building, and of goodly pride:\\n    then if he thrive and i be cast away,\\n    the worst was this,--my love was my decay.\\n\\n  lxxxi\\n\\n  or i shall live your epitaph to make,\\n  or you survive when i in earth am rotten;\\n  from hence your memory death cannot take,\\n  although in me each part will be forgotten.\\n  your name from hence immortal life shall have,\\n  though i, once gone, to all the world must die:\\n  the earth can yield me but a common grave,\\n  when you entombed in men's eyes shall lie.\\n  your monument shall be my gentle verse,\\n  which eyes not yet created shall o'er-read;\\n  and tongues to be, your being shall rehearse,\\n  when all the breathers of this world are dead;\\n    you still shall live,--such virtue hath my pen,--\\n    where breath most breathes, even in the mouths of men.\\n\\n  lxxxii\\n\\n  i grant thou wert not married to my muse,\\n  and therefore mayst without attaint o'erlook\\n  the dedicated words which writers use\\n  of their fair subject, blessing every book.\\n  thou art as fair in knowledge as in hue,\\n  finding thy worth a limit past my praise;\\n  and therefore art enforced to seek anew\\n  some fresher stamp of the time-bettering days.\\n  and do so, love; yet when they have devis'd,\\n  what strained touches rhetoric can lend,\\n  thou truly fair, wert truly sympathiz'd\\n  in true plain words, by thy true-telling friend;\\n    and their gross painting might be better us'd\\n    where cheeks need blood; in thee it is abus'd.\\n\\n  lxxxiii\\n\\n  i never saw that you did painting need,\\n  and therefore to your fair no painting set;\\n  i found, or thought i found, you did exceed\\n  that barren tender of a poet's debt:\\n  and therefore have i slept in your report,\\n  that you yourself, being extant, well might show\\n  how far a modern quill doth come too short,\\n  speaking of worth, what worth in you doth grow.\\n  this silence for my sin you did impute,\\n  which shall be most my glory being dumb;\\n  for i impair not beauty being mute,\\n  when others would give life, and bring a tomb.\\n    there lives more life in one of your fair eyes\\n    than both your poets can in praise devise.\\n\\n  lxxxiv\\n\\n  who is it that says most, which can say more,\\n  than this rich praise,--that you alone, are you?\\n  in whose confine immured is the store\\n  which should example where your equal grew.\\n  lean penury within that pen doth dwell\\n  that to his subject lends not some small glory;\\n  but he that writes of you, if he can tell\\n  that you are you, so dignifies his story,\\n  let him but copy what in you is writ,\\n  not making worse what nature made so clear,\\n  and such a counterpart shall fame his wit,\\n  making his style admired every where.\\n    you to your beauteous blessings add a curse,\\n    being fond on praise, which makes your praises worse.\\n\\n  lxxxv\\n\\n  my tongue-tied muse in manners holds her still,\\n  while comments of your praise richly compil'd,\\n  reserve their character with golden quill,\\n  and precious phrase by all the muses fil'd.\\n  i think good thoughts, whilst others write good words,\\n  and like unlettered clerk still cry 'amen'\\n  to every hymn that able spirit affords,\\n  in polish'd form of well-refined pen.\\n  hearing you praised, i say ''tis so, 'tis true,'\\n  and to the most of praise add something more;\\n  but that is in my thought, whose love to you,\\n  though words come hindmost, holds his rank before.\\n    then others, for the breath of words respect,\\n    me for my dumb thoughts, speaking in effect.\\n\\n  lxxxvi\\n\\n  was it the proud full sail of his great verse,\\n  bound for the prize of all too precious you,\\n  that did my ripe thoughts in my brain inhearse,\\n  making their tomb the womb wherein they grew?\\n  was it his spirit, by spirits taught to write,\\n  above a mortal pitch, that struck me dead?\\n  no, neither he, nor his compeers by night\\n  giving him aid, my verse astonished.\\n  he, nor that affable familiar ghost\\n  which nightly gulls him with intelligence,\\n  as victors of my silence cannot boast;\\n  i was not sick of any fear from thence:\\n    but when your countenance fill'd up his line,\\n    then lacked i matter; that enfeebled mine.\\n\\n  lxxxvii\\n\\n  farewell! thou art too dear for my possessing,\\n  and like enough thou know'st thy estimate,\\n  the charter of thy worth gives thee releasing;\\n  my bonds in thee are all determinate.\\n  for how do i hold thee but by thy granting?\\n  and for that riches where is my deserving?\\n  the cause of this fair gift in me is wanting,\\n  and so my patent back again is swerving.\\n  thy self thou gav'st, thy own worth then not knowing,\\n  or me to whom thou gav'st it, else mistaking;\\n  so thy great gift, upon misprision growing,\\n  comes home again, on better judgement making.\\n    thus have i had thee, as a dream doth flatter,\\n    in sleep a king, but waking no such matter.\\n\\n  lxxxviii\\n\\n  when thou shalt be dispos'd to set me light,\\n  and place my merit in the eye of scorn,\\n  upon thy side, against myself i'll fight,\\n  and prove thee virtuous, though thou art forsworn.\\n  with mine own weakness, being best acquainted,\\n  upon thy part i can set down a story\\n  of faults conceal'd, wherein i am attainted;\\n  that thou in losing me shalt win much glory:\\n  and i by this will be a gainer too;\\n  for bending all my loving thoughts on thee,\\n  the injuries that to myself i do,\\n  doing thee vantage, double-vantage me.\\n    such is my love, to thee i so belong,\\n    that for thy right, myself will bear all wrong.\\n\\n  lxxxix\\n\\n  say that thou didst forsake me for some fault,\\n  and i will

cannot dispraise, but in a kind of praise;\\n  naming thy name, blesses an ill report.\\n  o! what a mansion have those vices got\\n  which for their habitation chose out thee,\\n  where beauty's veil

what freezings have i felt, what dark days seen!\\n  what old december's bareness everywhere!\\n  and yet this time removed was summer's time;\\n  the teeming autumn, big with rich increase,\\n  bearing the wanton burden of the prime,\\n  like widow'd wombs after their lords' decease:\\n  yet this abundant issue seem'd to me\\n  but hope of orphans, and unfather'd fruit;\\n  for summer and

 from you have i been absent in the spring,\\n  when proud-pied april, dress'd in all his trim,\\n  hath put a spirit of youth in every thing,\\n  that heavy saturn laugh'd and leap'd with him.\\n  yet nor the lays of birds, nor the sweet smell\\n  of different flowers in odour and in hue,\\n  could make me any summer's story tell,\\n  or from their proud lap pluck them where they grew:\\n  nor did i wonder at the lily's white,\\n  nor praise the deep vermilion in the rose;\\n  they were but sweet, but figures of delight,\\n  drawn after you, you pattern of all those.\\n    yet seem'd it winter still, and you away,\\n    as with your shadow i with these did play.\\n\\n  xcix\\n\\n  the forward violet thus did i chide:\\n  sweet thief, whence didst thou steal thy sweet that smells,\\n  if not from my love's breath? the purple pride\\n  which on thy soft cheek for complexion dwells\\n  in my love's veins thou hast too grossly dy'd.\\n  the lily i condemned for thy hand,\\n  and buds of marjoram had stol'n thy hair;\\n  the roses fearfully on thorns did stand,\\n  one blushing shame, another white despair;\\n  a third, nor red nor white, had stol'n of both,\\n  and to his robbery had annex'd thy breath;\\n  but, for his theft, in pride of all his growth\\n  a vengeful canker eat him up to death.\\n    more flowers i noted, yet i none could see,\\n    but sweet, or colour it had stol'n from thee.\\n\\n  c\\n\\n  where art thou muse that thou forget'st so long,\\n  to speak of that which gives thee all thy might?\\n  spend'st thou thy fury on some worthless song,\\n  darkening thy power to lend base subjects light?\\n  return forgetful muse, and straight redeem,\\n  in gentle numbers time so idly spent;\\n  sing to the ear that doth thy lays esteem\\n  and gives thy pen both skill and argument.\\n  rise, resty muse, my love's sweet face survey,\\n  if time have any wrinkle graven there;\\n  if any, be a satire to decay,\\n  and make time's spoils despised every where.\\n    give my love fame faster than time wastes life,\\n    so thou prevent'st his scythe and crooked knife.\\n\\n  ci\\n\\n  o truant muse what shall be thy amends\\n  for thy neglect of truth in beauty dy'd?\\n  both truth and beauty on my love depends;\\n  so dost thou too, and therein dignified.\\n  make answer muse: wilt thou not haply say,\\n  'truth needs no colour, with his colour fix'd;\\n  beauty no pencil, beauty's truth to lay;\\n  but best is best, if never intermix'd'?\\n  because he needs no praise, wilt thou be dumb?\\n  excuse not silence so, for't lies in thee\\n  to make him much outlive a gilded tomb\\n  and to be prais'd of ages yet to be.\\n    then do thy office, muse; i teach thee how\\n    to make him seem long hence as he shows now.\\n\\n  cii\\n\\n  my love is strengthen'd, though more weak in seeming;\\n  i love not less, though less the show appear;\\n  that love is merchandiz'd, whose rich esteeming,\\n  the owner's tongue doth publish every where.\\n  our love was new, and then but in the spring,\\n  when i was wont to greet it with my lays;\\n  as philomel in summer's front doth sing,\\n  and stops her pipe in growth of riper days:\\n  not that the summer is less pleasant now\\n  than when her mournful hymns did hush the night,\\n  but that wild music burthens every bough,\\n  and sweets grown common lose their dear delight.\\n    therefore like her, i sometime hold my tongue:\\n    because i would not dull you with my song.\\n\\n  ciii\\n\\n  alack! what poverty my muse brings forth,\\n  that having such a scope to show her pride,\\n  the argument, all bare, is of more worth\\n  than when it hath my added praise beside!\\n  o! blame me not, if i no more can write!\\n  look in your glass, and there appears a face\\n  that over-goes my blunt invention quite,\\n  dulling my lines, and doing me disgrace.\\n  were it not sinful then, striving to mend,\\n  to mar the subject that before was well?\\n  for to no other pass my verses tend\\n  than of your graces and your gifts to tell;\\n    and more, much more, than in my verse can sit,\\n    your own glass shows you when you look in it.\\n\\n  civ\\n\\n  to me, fair friend, you never can be old,\\n  for as you were when first your eye i ey'd,\\n  such seems your beauty still. three winters cold,\\n  have from the forests shook three summers' pride,\\n  three beauteous springs to yellow autumn turn'd,\\n  in process of the seasons have i seen,\\n  three april perfumes in three hot junes burn'd,\\n  since first i saw you fresh, which yet are green.\\n  ah! yet doth beauty like a dial-hand,\\n  steal from his figure, and no pace perceiv'd;\\n  so your sweet hue, which methinks still doth stand,\\n  hath motion, and mine eye may be deceiv'd:\\n    for fear of which, hear this thou age unbred:\\n    ere you were born was beauty's summer dead.\\n\\n  cv\\n\\n  let not my love be call'd idolatry,\\n  nor my beloved as an idol show,\\n  since all alike my songs and praises be\\n  to one, of one, still such, and ever so.\\n  kind is my love to-day, to-morrow kind,\\n  still constant in a wondrous excellence;\\n  therefore my verse to constancy confin'd,\\n  one thing expressing, leaves out difference.\\n  'fair, kind, and true,' is all my argument,\\n  'fair, kind, and true,' varying to other words;\\n  and in this change is my invention spent,\\n  three themes in one, which wondrous scope affords.\\n    fair, kind, and true, have often liv'd alone,\\n    which three till now, never kept seat in one.\\n\\n  cvi\\n\\n  when in the chronicle of wasted time\\n  i see descriptions of the fairest wights,\\n  and beauty making beautiful old rime,\\n  in praise of ladies dead and lovely knights,\\n  then, in the blazon of sweet beauty's best,\\n  of hand, of foot, of lip, of eye, of brow,\\n  i see their antique pen would have express'd\\n  even such a beauty as you master now.\\n  so all their praises are but prophecies\\n  of this our time, all you prefiguring;\\n  and for they looked but with divining eyes,\\n  they had not skill enough your worth to sing:\\n    for we, which now behold these present days,\\n    have eyes to wonder, but lack tongues to praise.\\n\\n  cvii\\n\\n  not mine own fears, nor the prophetic soul\\n  of the wide world dreaming on things to come,\\n  can yet the lease of my true love control,\\n  supposed as forfeit to a confin'd doom.\\n  the mortal moon hath her eclipse endur'd,\\n  and the sad augurs mock their own presage;\\n  incertainties now crown themselves assur'd,\\n  and peace proclaims olives of endless age.\\n  now with the drops of this most balmy time,\\n  my love looks fresh, and death to me subscribes,\\n  since, spite of him, i'll live in this poor rime,\\n  while he insults o'er dull and speechless tribes:\\n    and thou in this shalt find thy monument,\\n    when tyrants' crests and tombs of brass are spent.\\n\\n  cviii\\n\\n  what's in the brain, that ink may character,\\n  which hath not figur'd to thee my true spirit?\\n  what's new to speak, what now to register,\\n  that may express my love, or thy dear merit?\\n  nothing, sweet boy; but yet, like prayers divine,\\n  i must each day say o'er the very same;\\n  counting no old thing old, thou mine, i thine,\\n  even as when first i hallow'd thy fair name.\\n  so that eternal love in love's fresh case,\\n  weighs not the dust and injury of age,\\n  nor gives to necessary wrinkles place,\\n  but makes antiquity for aye his page;\\n    finding the first conceit of love there bred,\\n    where time and outward form would show it dead.\\n\\n  cix\\n\\n  o! never say that i was false of heart,\\n  though absence seem'd my flame to qualify,\\n  as easy might i from my self depart\\n  as from my soul which in thy breast doth lie:\\n  that is my home of love: if i have rang'd,\\n  like him that travels, i return again;\\n  just to the time, not with the time exchang'd,\\n  so that myself bring water for my stain.\\n  never believe though in my nature reign'd,\\n  all frailties that besiege all kinds of blood,\\n  that it could so preposterously be stain'd,\\n  to leave
